Identify the REST API that you want to use for extracting space news. Ensure that the API provides the necessary data in a format that can be easily consumed by your application. You can use NASA's API, for example.

Set up a Node.js project. You can use a package manager like NPM or Yarn to manage your project dependencies. You will also need to install a web framework like Express to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Create an endpoint in your application that connects to the REST API and fetches the space news data. You can use a package like Axios to make HTTP requests.

Store the fetched data in a local database or memory cache for faster access. You can use a package like Redis to store the data in memory.

Create a user interface using HTML and CSS to display the fetched space news data. You can use a front-end framework like React or Vue.js to build the user interface.

Write JavaScript code to connect to your back-end API and fetch the space news data. You can use a package like Axios to make HTTP requests to your back-end API.

Display the fetched space news data on your user interface. You can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and display the data in a readable format.

Add features like pagination, search, and filtering to improve the user experience.

Test your application and make necessary adjustments to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

Deploy your application to a server or cloud hosting platform like Heroku or AWS.
